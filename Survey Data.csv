They become more easy to consume and digest and ultimately reviewer's eyes do not glaze over. As a project leader, I get to be in that fun position of encouraging and trying to provide initial upfront secure design feedback, and then in implementation I have to work to get the code completely published into review before we can really start to fully review the full scope of changes, which sometimes ultimately means that some reviews are too quick, but are still insufficient to approve changes to merge in our code review model. This allows encouragement without approval to merge/land without multiple. This is not to say every new contributor gets a free pass while getting their feature or fix into the review process, sometimes when we observe changes that are extremely insecure, we'll go ahead and block those changes and attempt to have a dialog with the contributor."
